# Richest Athletes (Forbes List 1980 - 2020)
  
## Introduction

This project conducts an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Forbes Richest Athletes List from 1990 to 2020.
The Forbes Richest Athletes List ranks athletes based on their earnings from endorsements, salaries, and other sources. This dataset provides valuable insights into the financial success of athletes across various sports over three decades.
The dataset includes details such as athlete name, sport, earnings for the year, endorsements, total earnings, and ranking on the Forbes list.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualization of trends in athletes' earnings over time.
- Analysis of the distribution of earnings across different sports.
- Identification of top-earning athletes in each year.
- Correlation analysis between earnings and other factors such as sport, age, and endorsements.
- Comparison of earnings across different sports categories.

## Analysis Contents

The EDA includes the following analyses and visualizations:

1. Historical Trends: Analyzing the trends in athlete earnings and wealth over the years.
2. Sport-wise Analysis: Exploring the distribution of earnings and wealth across different sports.
3. Top-Earning Athletes: Identifying the top-earning athletes and analyzing their sources of income (e.g., endorsements, salaries, prize money).
4. Endorsement Analysis: Investigating the role of endorsements in athletes' total earnings and their impact on rankings.
5. Regional Analysis: Examining the geographical distribution of top-earning athletes and the dominance of specific regions.

## Tools Used or Requirements

The analysis was performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with the code for the analysis.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the analysis and repository contents.

## How to use

To reproduce the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git clone <https://github.com/fortune-ncube/richest_atheletes_eda>```

2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
